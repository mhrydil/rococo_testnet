# Setting up local Rococo testnet

1. Follow the steps here: https://substrate.dev/cumulus-workshop/#/1-prep/1-compiling

The files in this repo exist to make the steps to run the network a bit simpler, but the process of compiling the relaychain template and collator are long and result in massive binaries, so they're not included here. Following along with the "Preparation" steps should get you to a point where you can use these files. If you have questions, let me know!
